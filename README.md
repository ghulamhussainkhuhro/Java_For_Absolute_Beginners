## üöÄ About the Project

**Java for Absolute Beginners** contains organized and well-explained code examples that cover a wide range of topics. You'll progress from understanding basic syntax and data structures to exploring advanced concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and graphical user interfaces (GUI).

We aim to make learning Java easy, fun, and practical by breaking down each concept into digestible parts. üí°
